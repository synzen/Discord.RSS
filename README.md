# Discord.RSS
Driven by the lack of comprehensive RSS bots available, I have decided to try my hand at creating one of my own. Designed with as much customization as possible for both users and bot hosters, while also (or should be) easy to understand.

All documentation can be found at https://github.com/synzen/Discord.RSS/wiki.

Looking for a non-Discord version of this bot? See https://github.com/synzen/feedtracker

### Publicly Hosted Instance

Don't want to bother hosting your own instance? Use the publicly hosted one!

### Setting Up via Cloning Repository (for most people)

See https://github.com/synzen/Discord.RSS/wiki/Setup

### Setting Up Programatically


```
npm install discord.rss
```

```js
const DiscordRSS = require('discord.rss')

// Optional config overrides
const config = {
  database: {
    uri: './sources'
  }
}

const drss = new DiscordRSS.ClientManager(config)
drss.login('token')
```
For best performance, use a mongodb database.uri instead of a directory.


### Web Interface

### Hosting on Glitch

Wait for the importing process to complete, make your project private and fill in the [Configuration](https://github.com/synzen/Discord.RSS/wiki/Configuration). Use a tool like [Uptime Robot](https://uptimerobot.com/) to prevent the bot from going offline.

You can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for the MongoDB database and [Redis Labs](https://redislabs.com/) for the Redis database.
